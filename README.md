# KevinSmith_SoloProject
A simple weather poll/social site where users can create, and answer, weather poll questions and also have the ability to check their weather.

P0 - User can create and vote on a poll. User can also check the tempurature via a weather API.

P1 - User can view results of a poll, delete a poll, and have up to three option on a poll. Poll, poll creation, and poll results will have their own page. User can search their city on a seperate page and have it show more information than just the tempurature.

P2 - User can ping their location in a weather app and link their poll to the ping. User can share polls to a social media site.

New-To-Me - Bootstrap and API's, some Django template languages such as: blocks and extensions. Widget tweaks.
